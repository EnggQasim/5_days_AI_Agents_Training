# Custom GPT Instructions Best Practices

Optimize syntactically the hell out of your instructions (and, if possible, of everything else, including the uploaded docs—yes, I know this’ll be a lot of work), making every word count, and don’t fear straying away from natural language: that’s for shorter prompts where you’re not pushing the AI’s token-chewing limits. Input & output are two very different beasts, and you can still output very smooth prose with near-telegraphic instructions, if the words you do use ask for it. Consider each word a trigger/keyword encapsulating a lot of meaning, and choose those that make the most difference.

Regarding the above, use normal ChatGPT to ask for help on how it would prompt it, explaining what you want the GPT to do. This serves a double purpose: first, it might give you good tips you didn’t think about; second, even if it doesn’t, look at the words it uses to describe it. If it uses those words a lot, it means they’re highly tied to the task in question, in its body of training. For that reason, those are particularly effective triggers. Example: ChatGPT ironically likes to describe simple language as “approachable” or “accessible”; well, no matter if they’re bigger words, if ChatGPT associates them so much to it, use one of them ;)

Feed the actual instructions in two ways: one as said above, and another in an uploaded document (that you’ll ask the GPT to always read first) that basically says the same, but sacrificing less detail, nuance, examples or whatever. That way, the GPT will get a better sense of the whole task, and keep it for as long as it can (as the user conversation progresses); and the essence of it will remain in memory through those more condensed main instructions (being system instructions that can’t be forgotten).

As much as possible, make those instructions know when to read one of the uploaded documents specific to what the user is asking at any particular moment. For example, if the user asks to write a blog, the GPT should first read the uploaded document containing info about persona/voice tone, whereas if the user asks for anything about the company, it should then read the related document. Btw, this, too, is why you want to optimize those documents as much as possible—GPT can’t always read long ones in their entirety, and often will do a cursory search for the related section and call it a day with whatever it’ll read from it—if it manages to find the section.

If everything else fails or it’s still not enough, consider making several GPTs, one for each specific task. There’s only so much (in fact, relatively little) you can achieve in making a single GPT self-adaptive for many different tasks—it’ll complicate the main instructions way too much. If that’s what it takes, make a sort of “portal GPT” specialized in just finding out what the user wants at the moment, and directing him with a link to the specialized GPT for it. It might seem cumbersome—and probably is—but many end users won’t necessarily appreciate having to bookmark a lot of different GPTs and remember what each one is for. That’s where this “portal GPT” would help, they’d only need to bookmark & start with that one, asking them what they want to do, and then click the link your “portal GPT” would generate.(*)

(*) In principle you could do this better with a simple portal website having the appropriate links with explanations. But many clients are likely not to care to read long-enough explanations of what each GPT does, while simultaneously complaining if shorter ones are unclear.
