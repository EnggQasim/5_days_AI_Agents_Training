# Custom GPTs vs Assistants

## Drawbacks of Using a Custom GPT System:

### Limited Access to User Interactions:

We lack access to user chat data, which prevents us from fine-tuning the model based on real user interactions and diverse user types.

### Uncertain Model Accuracy:

Without user data, we have no way to gauge the accuracy or effectiveness of the model in practice.

### Challenges in Improving User Experience:

The absence of user interaction data limits our ability to enhance and tailor the user experience effectively.
GUI Component Streaming:

We have a more effective solution for GUI component streaming through Vercel SDK, which may be better suited than a custom GPT system for some use cases.

## Message Limits for Free Users:

Free users are restricted to approximately 10 messages per day, with possible fluctuations based on the time of day. They are further limited to 3-5 messages every 5-6 hours, which could constrain the usability of our application. Additionally, one message is required as a starter prompt, leaving around 4 messages every 5 hours for user interactions.
