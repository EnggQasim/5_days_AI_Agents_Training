# Agentic AI with ChatGPT and Zapier - Module 2

## Overview
In this live session, we will dive deep into the concept of **Agentic AI**, its transformative impact, and how **GPT** (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) powers agentic capabilities. This module focuses on understanding the state-of-the-art concepts in Agentic AI and applying them to build **custom GPTs** with tools like **Zapier** to create powerful, automated systems.

## Key Concepts
1. **Agentic AI**: An advanced form of generative AI with agent-like behavior that can automate tasks, support your business, life, or work, and interact with real systems.
2. **Custom GPTs**: Customized versions of ChatGPT with the ability to perform specific tasks through natural language programming.
3. **No-Code Automations**: Using tools like Zapier to integrate AI-powered agents with real systems without needing deep programming skills.
4. **Automation**: Leveraging custom GPTs and Zapier to build automations in a simple, intuitive way.
