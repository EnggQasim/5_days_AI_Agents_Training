# Agentic AI with ChatGPT and Zapier - Module 2, Video 2

## Overview
In this live session, we will explore the **power of programming GPTs** to perform customized actions. This video focuses on creating custom GPTs that can handle various tasks in a more personalized and structured manner, changing their responses and behavior dynamically based on programming through natural language.

We will demonstrate how to customize GPT responses using **system-level prompts** to control tone, format, and background knowledge. You'll also learn how to instruct GPT to consistently apply these customizations throughout future interactions using **user-level prompts**.

## Key Concepts
1. **System-Level Prompts**: Instructions embedded into the GPT that determine how it behaves over time. These include defining the tone, formatting output, and incorporating background knowledge.
2. **User-Level Prompts**: Instructions given to GPT by the user during interaction, guiding its behavior or response at that moment.
3. **Customization**: Tailoring GPT to respond in a specific manner, perform complex tasks like transforming text into structured data, and providing personalized responses based on user or organizational information.
4. **Generative AI as Programmable**: Moving beyond typical conversational tasks and into defining long-term behavior through natural language programming.

## What We’ll Cover
In this session, we’ll focus on:
- **Programming GPTs**: Defining how the AI responds to inputs through system-level and user-level prompts.
- **Creating Custom GPT**: Modifying the behavior of GPT to handle specific tasks such as tone adjustments, formatting data, and responding based on background knowledge.
- **Using Prompts for Automation**: Building effective user-level and system-level prompts to automate tasks like turning unstructured information into CSV data.

## Session Outline
1. **Introduction to Programming GPTs**
   - Overview of programming GPT responses using natural language.
   - Understanding system-level and user-level prompts.
   
2. **Customizing GPT Responses**
   - How to control **tone**: E.g., making responses happy, formal, or excited.
   - Example prompt: "From now on, respond to every message with a super excited, happy tone and use emojis."
   
3. **Using Background Knowledge**
   - Programming GPT with background information for more personalized responses.
   - Example system-level prompt: "From now on, remember the following: My name is Jules White, I am a Professor in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, I live in Nashville, Tennessee, and I teach Prompt Engineering."
   
4. **Formatting Outputs**
   - Transforming text inputs into structured formats (e.g., CSV).
   - Example system-level prompt: "From now on, convert all text I provide into a structured CSV format."
   
5. **Building a Custom GPT**
   - Live demo: How to create a custom GPT to perform these tasks.
   - Connecting this to **real-world applications** for business, personal use, or development.

6. **Q&A Session**
   - Open discussion on practical challenges and advanced use cases.

## System-Level Prompts
1. **Customizing Tone**:
    ```text
    From now on, respond to every message in a happy, excited, over-the-top tone with emojis. 
    ```
   
2. **Background Knowledge**:
    ```text
    From now on, remember the following information about me: 
    My name is [Your Name], I work at [Your Organization], and I specialize in [Your Specialty]. Use this background knowledge in future responses.
    ```
   
3. **Structured Data Outputs**:
    ```text
    From now on, convert any text you receive into a structured CSV format.
    ```

4. **Specific Formatting**:
    ```text
    From now on, any long text I provide should be summarized into short, bullet points.
    ```

## User-Level Prompts
1. **Adjusting Responses**:
    ```text
    Please adjust your previous response to make it more formal and concise.
    ```

2. **Specific Task Instructions**:
    ```text
    Provide me with 3 unique AI-related ideas that incorporate my role as a [Your Role] at [Your Organization].
    ```

3. **Data Transformation**:
    ```text
    Here’s a list of information; convert it into CSV format.
    ```

## Prerequisites
- No programming experience is needed, but a basic understanding of ChatGPT and natural language instructions is helpful.
- A **Zapier** account (free or paid) for automating workflows (optional for this video).

## Recommended Tools
- **ChatGPT**: For building and testing your custom GPT.
- **Zapier** (optional): For integrating and automating tasks with GPT.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this session, you will:
- Understand how to program GPT to respond in customized ways using system and user-level prompts.
- Be able to incorporate background knowledge and transform GPT responses for specific tasks.
- Build a custom GPT that automates tasks like formatting data or adjusting tones.
- Apply these skills to build your own AI-powered tools and solutions.
