# Custom GPT with Tool Capabilities

## Video-05: Integrating Tools with GPT

In this video, we explore how to extend the capabilities of GPT by giving it access to tools, such as web browsing and image generation using DALL-E. This enables GPT to go beyond text-based outputs and interact with external tools to fetch real-time data and generate visual content.

### System-Level Prompt

```json
{
  "name": "Custom GPT with Tools",
  "description": "This GPT has the ability to browse the web and generate images using DALL-E. It can create quizzes based on real-time information and enhance the output with visual content.",
  "capabilities": {
    "search": true,
    "dalle_image_generation": true
  },
  "actions": {
    "search_tool": {
      "type": "search",
      "description": "Allows GPT to search the web for real-time data using a search engine."
    },
    "image_generation_tool": {
      "type": "dalle",
      "description": "Allows GPT to generate images based on provided descriptions."
    }
  }
}
```

### User-Level Prompt Examples

- **Web Browsing with Search Tool:**

  ```plaintext
  Please search the internet for recent information about BMX racing and use that information to create a fun math quiz for me.
  ```

- **Image Generation with DALL-E:**

  ```plaintext
  Based on the results of the quiz, create an image representing a BMX race using the DALL-E tool.
  ```

### Minimum Steps to Create Custom GPT with Tool Access

1. **Set Up GPT Environment:**
   - Begin by defining your custom GPTâ€™s capabilities. This includes specifying tools that the GPT will have access to, such as web browsing and DALL-E for image generation.
   
2. **Define System-Level Prompts:**
   - Structure the system-level prompts to introduce tools and their descriptions, detailing the scope of actions GPT can take. This may include enabling web searches or image generation.

3. **Select or Build Tools:**
   - Either use pre-existing tools (such as web browsing or DALL-E), or you can plug in custom tools. The tool selection process happens during the setup of the GPT's environment.

4. **Set Instructions for Tool Usage:**
   - Define specific actions that the GPT will take when using tools, such as browsing for information and summarizing the results, or using DALL-E to generate images based on the output.
   
5. **Create User-Level Prompts:**
   - Write the user-level prompts that will trigger tool usage. These are the queries that users will input to get outputs involving real-time data fetching or image creation.

6. **Testing and Deployment:**
   - Test the GPT by providing prompts that request tool use. For example, ask it to fetch recent news or generate images. Ensure the tool integration works seamlessly.
