# Flipped Interaction Pattern in Generative AI

## Introduction
Welcome to the presentation on the Flipped Interaction Pattern in Generative AI. This README provides an overview of the concepts discussed, the structure of the presentation, and key takeaways.

## Key Concepts
1. **Flipped Interaction Pattern**: A novel approach where the AI system initiates interactions by asking questions or suggesting actions rather than waiting for user inputs.
2. **Agentic AI**: AI that acts autonomously, adapting to the information it receives and performing tasks to achieve a specified goal.
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective prompts to guide AI behavior and interactions.

## Presentation Outline

### 1. Introduction to Flipped Interaction Pattern
- Explanation of the flipped interaction concept.
- Comparison with traditional AI interaction models.

### 2. The Basis of Flipped Interaction
- Importance of the pattern in generative AI systems.
- Real-world analogy: The protocol droid from Star Wars.

### 3. Structure of the Flipped Interaction Pattern
- Initial prompt setup.
- Asking questions one at a time.
- Adapting to user responses dynamically.

### 4. Practical Example: Restaurant Recommendation
- Step-by-step walkthrough of a generative AI system suggesting a restaurant.
- Highlighting the importance of dynamic adaptation in responses.

### 5. Agentic AI in Action
- Description of how agentic AI operates.
- Interaction with databases and other systems.
