# Understanding Agentic AI Systems: Tools and Actions

## Overview

This presentation explores how agentic AI systems interact with the world using predefined tools or actions. It demonstrates how these AI systems can solve problems within constrained environments by leveraging specified resources and actions. The example provided illustrates the cooking process with limited utensils and a wood fire.

## Key Concepts

### Agentic AI Systems
- **Definition**: AI systems designed to autonomously accomplish tasks by interacting with the environment through predefined tools or actions.
- **Importance**: Ensures AI systems operate within constraints, avoiding arbitrary or impractical solutions.

### Tools vs. Actions
- **Tools**: Physical or virtual items the AI can instruct a human or system to use.
- **Actions**: Specific operations the AI can instruct to perform tasks.
- **Contextual Use**: Tools are flexible and suited for human interaction, while actions are finite and better for rigid systems.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Cooking Example
1. **Define Tools**:
   - 1-quart sauté pan
   - Skillet
   - Large cast iron skillet
   - Wood fire (using oak)

2. **Initial Query**:
   - **AI Prompt**: "What do you want to cook today?"
   - **User Response**: "Pizza on the wood fire with a skillet or sauté pan."

3. **Gather Ingredients**:
   - **AI Instruction**: "Gather your ingredients."
   - **User Action**: Collect ingredients and confirm.

4. **Prepare Dough**:
   - **AI Instruction**: "Prepare the dough."
   - **User Action**: Follow instructions and confirm.

5. **Prepare Wood Fire**:
   - **AI Instruction**: "Prepare the wood fire."
   - **User Action**: Set up the fire and confirm.

6. **Preheat Skillet**:
   - **AI Instruction**: "Place the cast iron skillet on the fire and let it preheat."
   - **User Action**: Preheat skillet and confirm.

7. **Cook Dough**:
   - **AI Instruction**: "Brush a thin layer of olive oil on the preheated skillet and cook the dough."
   - **User Action**: Cook dough and confirm.

8. **Add Toppings**:
   - **AI Instruction**: "Add the toppings to the dough."
   - **User Action**: Add toppings and confirm.

9. **Final Steps**:
   - **AI Instruction**: "Place the skillet on the wood fire and cook the pizza."
   - **User Action**: Cook pizza and confirm completion.

## Real-World Application

### Constraints and Limitations
- **Defined Tools and Actions**: AI must work within specified boundaries to ensure practical and feasible solutions.
- **Interfacing with Systems**: Actions need to be explicitly defined when interacting with rigid systems like CRMs or email servers.

### Flexibility and Adaptation
- **Human Interaction**: Use tools flexibly for human-operated tasks.
- **Computer Systems**: Define actions for systems with limited capabilities.

## Conclusion

This presentation highlights the importance of defining tools and actions for agentic AI systems to operate effectively within constraints. By illustrating with a cooking example, we see how AI can adapt and provide step-by-step guidance using specified resources. This approach ensures AI systems provide practical solutions tailored to the available tools and actions.
