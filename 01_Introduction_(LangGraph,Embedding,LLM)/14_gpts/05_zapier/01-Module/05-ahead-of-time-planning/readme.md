# Planning and Executing Tasks with AI: Interactive vs. Pre-Baked Plans

## Overview

This presentation explores two primary methods for leveraging AI agents to plan and execute tasks: interactive step-by-step execution and pre-baked comprehensive planning. By examining both approaches, we highlight the strengths, limitations, and potential applications of each method.

## Key Concepts

### Interactive Step-by-Step Execution
- **Definition**: The AI agent performs tasks interactively, one step at a time, responding to user inputs and adapting its actions based on feedback.
- **Benefits**: High adaptability, ability to correct mistakes on the fly, and responsive to real-time changes.
- **Challenges**: Potential for losing track of the overall goal, increased complexity, and longer execution times.

### Pre-Baked Comprehensive Planning
- **Definition**: The AI agent creates a complete plan in advance, which is then executed without further input from the agent.
- **Benefits**: Increased efficiency, predictability, and repeatability of tasks.
- **Challenges**: Inflexibility to adapt to changes or correct mistakes during execution, higher risk of errors in the initial plan.

## Examples

### Example 1: Diagnosing Internet Connectivity Issues
- **Interactive Method**: The AI agent guides the user through a series of steps, asking for screenshots and providing instructions based on real-time inputs.
  - **Step 1**: Ask for a screenshot of the current system.
  - **Step 2**: Check Wi-Fi connection.
  - **Step 3**: Verify network preferences.
  - **Step 4**: Check internet connectivity via terminal commands.
- **Outcome**: The AI adapts its instructions based on the information provided at each step, ensuring accurate diagnosis.

### Example 2: Planning a Four-Day Trip to Nashville
- **Pre-Baked Method**: The AI agent creates a detailed four-day itinerary in advance, including activities and neighborhoods to visit.
  - **Day 1**: Downtown Nashville, breakfast at Pancake Pantry.
  - **Day 2**: Explore East Nashville.
  - **Day 3**: Visit 12 South and Belmont/Hillsboro Village.
  - **Day 4**: Conclude with a trip to Germantown and The Gulch.
- **Outcome**: The plan is efficient and predictable, but lacks adaptability if there are errors or changes in preferences.

### Example 3: Planning a BMX Road Trip
- **Interactive Method**: The AI agent interacts step-by-step, planning stops in cities with BMX tracks.
- **Pre-Baked Method**: The AI agent creates a complete road trip plan in advance, ensuring stops in cities with verified BMX tracks.
  - **Original Plan**: Included fictitious BMX track (Hummelstown BMX).
  - **Improved Plan**: Corrected by providing the AI with a list of real BMX tracks, resulting in accurate stops.
- **Outcome**: The pre-baked plan is now accurate and efficient, but was initially prone to hallucination errors.

## Conclusion

This presentation illustrates the strengths and limitations of interactive and pre-baked planning methods using AI agents. Interactive methods offer high adaptability and accuracy, while pre-baked methods provide efficiency and repeatability. The choice of method depends on the task requirements and the need for adaptability versus efficiency.
