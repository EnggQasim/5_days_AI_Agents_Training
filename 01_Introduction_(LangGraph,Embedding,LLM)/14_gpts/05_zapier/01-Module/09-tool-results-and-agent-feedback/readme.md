## Agentic AI: Utilizing Tools and Feedback for Effective Problem-Solving

### Overview
This document presents a detailed approach to building and managing an Agentic AI system that utilizes tools and feedback to solve problems and perform tasks effectively. The key concept is to provide the AI with the results of its actions, allowing it to adapt and proceed with the next steps autonomously.

### Critical Steps for Effective Agentic AI

1. **Goal Initialization**:
   - Define the goal for the AI.
   - Instruct the AI to perform actions step-by-step and adapt based on feedback.

2. **Action Specification**:
   - The AI specifies an action to be performed.
   - Human or system executes the action.

3. **Result Feedback**:
   - Provide the AI with the outcome of the performed action.
   - The AI interprets the result and determines the next action.

4. **Iterative Process**:
   - Repeat the process of action specification and result feedback until the goal is achieved.

### Example: Cooking a Quesadilla with a Microwave

#### Tools (Actions)
- `microwave_get_current_time`
- `microwave_reset_time`
- `microwave_increase_time`
- `microwave_stop`
- `microwave_start`
- `microwave_open_door`
- `microwave_close_door`
- `insert_food_in_microwave`

#### Workflow Simulation

1. **Initial Goal**:
   - Goal: Reheat a quesadilla in the microwave.
   - Instructions: Use the provided tools and complete one step at a time, waiting for a description of the outcome before proceeding.

2. **Step-by-Step Execution**:
   - **AI**: "Insert the quesadilla in the microwave. Use `insert_food_in_microwave`."
   - **Human/System**: Executes and provides result: "Food in microwave."

   - **AI**: "Increase the microwave time. Use `microwave_increase_time`."
   - **Human/System**: Executes and provides result: "Time increased by 5 seconds."

   - **AI**: "Continue to use `microwave_increase_time` until the desired time is reached."
   - **Human/System**: Executes and provides result: "Time increased to 60 seconds."

   - **AI**: "Start the microwave. Use `microwave_start`."
   - **Human/System**: Error: "Door open."

   - **AI**: "Close the microwave door. Use `microwave_close_door`."
   - **Human/System**: Executes and provides result: "Door closed."

   - **AI**: "Start the microwave. Use `microwave_start`."
   - **Human/System**: Executes and provides result: "Microwave is running."

   - **AI**: "When done, open the door and remove the quesadilla. Use `microwave_open_door`."

3. **Importance of Detailed Feedback**:
   - Provide clear and understandable error messages.
   - Translate error codes into meaningful information for the AI to interpret.
   - Ensure feedback is rich in detail to prevent the AI from getting stuck in loops.

### Best Practices for Agentic AI Development

- **Action Naming**: Use clear, programmer-friendly names for actions to facilitate understanding and execution.
- **Result Feedback**: Always provide the result of the executed action, including error messages with detailed explanations.
- **Adaptability**: Ensure the AI can adapt to new information and make informed decisions based on feedback.
- **Error Handling**: Focus on creating intelligent error messages to help the AI understand and resolve issues autonomously.

### Conclusion

The outlined approach emphasizes the importance of providing detailed feedback to the AI for each action performed. By simulating real-world scenarios and ensuring the AI receives accurate and comprehensive information, we can develop robust Agentic AI systems capable of effectively solving problems and performing tasks autonomously.

Tools:
----------
microwave_get_current_time 
microwave_reset_time 
microwave_increase_time 
microwave_stop 
microwave_start 
microwave_open_door 
microwave_close_door 
insert_food_in_microwave

Notes: You must set the time on the microwave to start it. You must work independently without input from me.

You are going to help me cook food in the microwave. You can only use the provided tools and refer to them by their name. You must complete one step at a time and wait for a description of the outcome.

Tell me the first step to reheat a quesadilla.
