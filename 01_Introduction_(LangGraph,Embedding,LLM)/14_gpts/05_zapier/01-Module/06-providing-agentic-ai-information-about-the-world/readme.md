# Understanding the Information Needs of Generative AI

## Overview

This presentation explores the critical aspect of providing generative AI systems with sufficient context and information to perform tasks accurately. The analogy of an intern on their first day is used to illustrate the level of detail and continuous updates required for effective AI task execution.

## Key Concepts

### Overestimating AI Knowledge
- **Common Assumption**: Users often overestimate the knowledge of generative AI systems due to their convincing outputs.
- **Reality**: AI systems require explicit and detailed context to understand and perform tasks correctly.

### Importance of Context
- **Detailed Information**: Like an intern, AI needs comprehensive background information to function effectively.
- **Examples**: Specific details about systems, goals, and environment are crucial for accurate task execution.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Example 1: Setting Up a Nintendo Wii
- **Scenario**: Connecting an old Nintendo Wii to a modern TV without an HDMI port.
- **Challenges**: Identifying the correct inputs and connections behind a wall-mounted TV.
- **Solution**: Providing AI with a photo of the TV inputs for accurate guidance.

### Example 2: Using a Coffee Maker
- **Scenario**: Explaining how to use a Keurig coffee maker.
- **Challenges**: A generic term like "coffee maker" is insufficient.
- **Solution**: Providing a photo of the specific Keurig model for detailed instructions.

## Continuous Updates
- **Dynamic Information**: AI requires continuous updates about the state of the world to adapt its plans.
- **Example**: Planning travel reservations while considering potential changes by other parties.

## Adapting to Changes
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: AI must adjust its plans based on new information to avoid incorrect decisions.
- **Example**: Updating AI about simultaneous travel reservations to prevent duplicates.

## Conclusion
- **Critical Insight**: For generative AI to perform tasks accurately, it must be provided with detailed, continuous, and context-specific information.
- **Analogy**: Treat AI like a new intern, offering explicit instructions and regular updates to ensure successful task completion.
