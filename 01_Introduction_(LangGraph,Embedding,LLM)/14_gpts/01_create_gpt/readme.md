# Creating a Custom GPT

Detailed guide on creating a custom GPT with OpenAI:

**Prerequisites:**

* An OpenAI account with a ChatGPT Plus or Enterprise subscription (Custom GPTs are not available on free plans).

**Steps:**

1. **Access the GPT Builder:** Navigate to the GPT builder through two options:
   - Visit [https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554397-creating-a-gpt](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554397-creating-a-gpt) directly.
   - If you're already logged in to ChatGPT, click on your username and then select "My GPTs". There, you'll find the option to "Create a GPT".

2. **Interact with the GPT Builder:** The GPT Builder uses a conversational interface. Briefly describe the purpose of your custom GPT. 

3. **Provide Core Details (Create Tab):** 
   - **Name and Description:** Craft a clear and descriptive name for your GPT and a brief explanation of its function.

4. **Configure Your GPT (Configure Tab):** This tab allows for further customization. Here's what you can adjust:
   - **Profile Picture:** Upload your own image or use OpenAI's DALLE-2 to generate one that reflects your GPT's purpose. 
   - **Additional Instructions:** Here's where you refine your GPT's behavior and capabilities. Provide detailed instructions and guidelines on:
      - How your GPT should respond and interact.
      - Specific tasks it should be able to perform.
      - Unwanted behaviors to avoid. 

5. **Fine-tune with Conversation Starters:** Conversation starters are prompts that guide your GPT's responses in specific situations. You can add prompts or remove existing ones based on your needs.


6. **Perfect Instruction Writer:**

**Sharing and Publishing (Optional):**

- By default, your custom GPT is private and only accessible to you. 
- In the top right corner, you can choose sharing options:
   - **Anyone with the Link:** Anyone with a ChatGPT subscription who has the link can access your GPT.
   - **Public:** Publish your GPT to the GPT Store (coming soon), making it available to everyone.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Leverage Examples:** Explore existing GPTs in the GPT Store (once available) for inspiration and to see how others have structured their custom models. 
- **Start Simple:** Begin with a focused purpose for your GPT and gradually add complexity as you refine it.
- **Iterate and Improve:**  The more you interact with your GPT and provide feedback, the better it will learn and adapt to your requirements.

By following these steps and using the GPT Builder's features, you can create a custom OpenAI GPT tailored to your specific needs and interests.

## Tutorials

Here are some tutorials that provide examples of creating custom GPTs with OpenAI:

* **Video Tutorial: How to Create Custom GPTs in 5 Minutes (OpenAI GPTs Tutorial for Beginners)** ([YouTube](youtube.com)): This video offers a concise walkthrough, guiding you through creating a "Smith's Solar Sales Assistant" GPT. It demonstrates defining the GPT's purpose, instructions, and even integrating a custom action for calculations.

* **Blog Post: How to Make Custom ChatGPT Models: 5 Easy Steps to Personalized GPTs** ([DataCamp](datacamp.com)): This blog delves into the five core steps of building a custom GPT. While not directly providing examples, it offers a clear breakdown of the process, making it easier to follow along with other example-focused tutorials.

* **Additional Resources:** While not directly tutorials, exploring existing GPTs in the OpenAI GPT Store (once available) can serve as valuable examples. You'll be able to see how others have structured their GPTs for various purposes, giving you inspiration and ideas for your own creations.

Remember, the key to effective custom GPT creation lies in clearly defining its purpose and providing specific instructions and examples. The tutorials above will equip you with the steps and some illustrative approaches to get you started.

## Drawbacks of Using a Custom GPT System:

### Limited Access to User Interactions:

We lack access to user chat data, which prevents us from fine-tuning the model based on real user interactions and diverse user types.

### Uncertain Model Accuracy:

Without user data, we have no way to gauge the accuracy or effectiveness of the model in practice.

### Challenges in Improving User Experience:

The absence of user interaction data limits our ability to enhance and tailor the user experience effectively.
GUI Component Streaming:

We have a more effective solution for GUI component streaming through Vercel SDK, which may be better suited than a custom GPT system for some use cases.

## Message Limits for Free Users:

Free users are restricted to approximately 10 messages per day, with possible fluctuations based on the time of day. They are further limited to 3-5 messages every 5-6 hours, which could constrain the usability of our application. Additionally, one message is required as a starter prompt, leaving around 4 messages every 5 hours for user interactions.
