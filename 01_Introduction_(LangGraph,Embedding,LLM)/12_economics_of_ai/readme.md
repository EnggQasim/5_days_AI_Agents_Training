# Economics of AI APIs

**We think in the near future the PyTorch framework and the Llama models will be widely used by enterprises who want to roll their own AI.**

## Serverless Open AI API vs Cloud Hosted Open Source LLMs

If you think of it Open AI Chat Completion API and Open AI Assistant are serverless api are serverless. This mean if your requests are low in number and intermitant it will be economical. However, if your api calls are consistant and are numeraus it is better to Host Llama 3 on a cloud provider and use it. As of now, LLaMA 3 is the most powerful open-source Large Language Model (LLM), this is why we mentioned it in our discussion. 

The OpenAI Chat Completion API and OpenAI Assistant are indeed serverless APIs. When your usage is sporadic or low, they can be quite economical. However, if you have a consistent stream of API calls, hosting your own instance of Llama 3 on a cloud provider might be a more cost-effective solution. It allows you to manage resources efficiently and tailor the setup to your specific needs.
