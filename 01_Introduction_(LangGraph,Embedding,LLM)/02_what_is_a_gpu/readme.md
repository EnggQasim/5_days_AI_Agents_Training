### CPU (Central Processing Unit)

**Definition:**
- The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing inside a computer.

**Functions:**
- Executes instructions from programs by performing basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output (I/O) operations.
- Acts as the brain of the computer where most calculations take place.

**Components:**
1. **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
2. **CU (Control Unit):** Directs the operation of the processor.
3. **Registers:** Small storage locations within the CPU for holding data temporarily.

**Characteristics:**
- General-purpose processor capable of handling a wide variety of tasks.
- Handles tasks sequentially.
- Consists of a few cores (usually 2 to 16 in consumer-grade CPUs).

**Use Cases:**
- Running operating systems.
- Executing applications such as word processors, web browsers, and spreadsheets.

### GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)

**Definition:**
- The GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized processor designed to accelerate graphics rendering.

**Functions:**
- Handles computations related to 3D graphics and image processing.
- Offloads and accelerates complex mathematical calculations, particularly those involving parallel processing.

**Components:**
1. **CUDA Cores (NVIDIA) / Stream Processors (AMD):** Execute parallel operations on large data sets.
2. **Memory (VRAM):** High-speed memory for storing images and textures.

**Characteristics:**
- Specialized for tasks that can be parallelized, such as graphics rendering and machine learning computations.
- Contains thousands of smaller, efficient cores designed for handling multiple tasks simultaneously.
- High memory bandwidth to manage large datasets and textures.

**Use Cases:**
- Rendering 3D graphics in video games.
- Running complex simulations and scientific computations.
- Training machine learning models.
- Video editing and processing.
